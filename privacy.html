                <h2 class="section-title">Privacy Policy</h2>
                <div class="policy-content">
                    <p><strong>Effective Date: September 17, 2025</strong></p>

                    <h3>1. Your Agreement</h3>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users who access or use the LuxPDF website and its tools. By using the site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use our Service.</p>

                    <h3>2. Our Privacy-First Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>The core functionality of LuxPDF is performed entirely on your device (client-side). We do not upload, process, or store your files on our servers. We do not track your IP address, browser activity, or session data, beyond what is captured by third-party services as outlined below. We do not sell, rent, or trade user data under any circumstances.</p>

                    <h3>3. Data Collection by Third-Party Services</h3>
                    <p>While LuxPDF itself does not collect your files or personal data, our website relies on a small number of third-party providers to deliver static assets, fonts, analytics, and optional donations. When your browser requests resources from these providers, they inevitably receive limited technical data such as your IP address, User-Agent, and timestamp in order to deliver content securely and efficiently.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recipients we use and purposes:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CDNs (infrastructure & delivery):</strong> Cloudflare (cdnjs.cloudflare.com), jsDelivr (cdn.jsdelivr.net), and UNPKG (unpkg.com) to serve JavaScript/CSS libraries. <em>Legal basis:</em> Legitimate interests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> To load the Inter webfont for consistent typography. <em>Legal basis:</em> Legitimate interests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
                        <li><strong>Plausible Analytics:</strong> To measure site usage without cookies or persistent identifiers. EU-hosted. <em>Legal basis:</em> Legitimate interests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
                        <li><strong>Buy Me a Coffee:</strong> Optional donations/sponsorships. Processes necessary payment data. <em>Legal basis:</em> Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b)) and/or legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>International transfers:</strong> Where data may be processed in the United States (e.g., by certain CDNs or Google Fonts), transfers rely on the provider’s EU–US Data Privacy Framework certification (if applicable) or on Standard Contractual Clauses with appropriate safeguards.</p>

                    <h4>Infrastructure & delivery (legitimate interests)</h4>
                    <p>We use reputable content delivery networks (CDNs) to serve static assets (e.g., JavaScript/CSS) so pages load fast and securely worldwide. When your browser fetches these files, the CDN receives limited technical data (IP address, User‑Agent, timestamp) for delivery and security (e.g., caching, DDoS protection).</p>

                    <h4>Fonts</h4>
                    <p>We currently load the Inter typeface via Google Fonts. This requires your browser to request the font files from Google’s servers, which provides Google with your IP address and User‑Agent. We are evaluating migration to self‑hosted fonts to avoid remote requests. Until then, the legal basis is legitimate interests (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).</p>

                    <h4>Analytics (legitimate interests)</h4>
                    <p>We use Plausible Analytics (EU‑hosted) to measure site usage without cookies or persistent identifiers. To count daily unique visits, Plausible briefly processes IP address and User‑Agent to create a rotating 24‑hour hash. The raw values aren’t stored; only aggregated statistics are retained. See Plausible’s data policy: <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plausible.io/data-policy</a>.</p>

                    <h3>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
                    <p>LuxPDF itself does not use cookies. Third‑party providers that we integrate (e.g., Buy Me a Coffee, Google Fonts) may use cookies or similar technologies where necessary to provide their services (e.g., load balancing, fraud prevention, payment flows). Please refer to each provider’s privacy policy for details and controls. You can also manage cookie behavior via your browser settings.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Do Not Track (DNT) Signals</h3>
                    <p>LuxPDF does not currently respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals from browsers. However, we are committed to your privacy and strive to limit tracking by avoiding unnecessary data collection wherever possible.</p>

                    <h3>6. Third-Party Links</h3>
                    <p>Our site may contain links to third-party websites, including Buy Me a Coffee. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.</p>

                    <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
                    <p>In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

                    <h3>8. Your Data Rights (EEA & California Residents)</h3>
                    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) or California, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or delete any information third-party services have collected about you. Since we do not hold your data, these requests should be directed to the respective third-party services. For questions or guidance on how to do this, you can contact us at: admin@luxpdf.com</p>

                    <h3>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

                    <h3>10. Contact Us</h3>
                    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: admin@luxpdf.com</p>
