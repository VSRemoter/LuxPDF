# LuxPDF: An Open-Source, Privacy-Focused PDF WebApp

LuxPDF is an Open-Source, Privacy-Focused Alternative to popular WebApps such as ILovePDF, Small PDF, PDFCandy, and FreeConvert. We offer 30+ Tools, all Free, with No Ads, No File Size Limits, Unlimited Batch Processing, No Registration Needed, & Unlimited Usage. We make it easy for anyone to modify their PDF File efficiently and with privacy in mind. We developed LuxPDF with two things in mind: Privacy and User Experience. We made LuxPDF to be completely, 100% client-side, meaning your PDF Files are never uploaded to any server ever. We can't and will never see what files you use on our WebApp. We also don't sell your data, have ads, or track you in any way. We are committed to your privacy and strive to limit tracking by avoiding unnecessary data collection wherever possible. LuxPDF was also built to be as code-efficient as possible, allowing you to convert, & modify your PDF File efficiently. We are funded by only two things: Sponsors, & Voluntary Donators. We believe this approach is the best way to fund our WebApp without having a PayWall or Ads that track your data, while being able to afford keeping our WebApp running.

## Our Mission

We believe that simple tools like PDF WebApps should have been open-sourced, privacy-focused, and free a long time ago. That's why we're committed to making the ultimate PDF WebApp for users. There's simply no other PDF WebApp that exists that is as privacy-focused, open-sourced, free, & as user-friendly as LuxPDF. LuxPDF is an ongoing mission to create the best PDF WebApp for all your needs.
