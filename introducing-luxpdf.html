            <article class="post-content">
                <p><strong>This whole journey started with helping my father with financial documents.</strong> He sent me photos (HEIC files) that needed to become a single, merged PDF file. A very easy task, right? I looked at the popular sites everyone recommends: Free Convert, PDF Candy, etc. And then I paused, and in my mind I imagined.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “How the actual hell do people trust these sites with sensitive files? Its closed source, with no privacy promises at all”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Those forms held <em>extremely personal</em> information, information that could be used for malicious intent if exposed. The more I looked at these PDF websites, the more uneasy I felt. All of these tools were closed source. Privacy promises were vague. Some required holding your emails and payment information to use. I myself couldn’t verify what actually happened to my files, and that was unacceptable.</p>

                <p>So I called a friend who shared the same exact problems as me. We decided to build the PDF WebApp we wished existed, which we named LuxPDF.</p>

                <p>Lux, is a unit of how bright light is, it is also a common shortened word for luxury. We chose the name LuxPDF
                    because we value transparency, clarity (like light), and we value giving people a premium, refined PDF experience they won't find anywhere else.
                </p>

                <p>LuxPDF's main differentiator is that you didn't need to trust what we say, you can check you code yourself in our repository. Our core values align with an old Russian proverb:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Trust, but verify"
                </blockquote>

                <p>From day one, we chose to be different, not by cramming in every feature possible, but by committing to a few non‑negotiables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy‑first.</strong> We design features with 100% confidentiality in mind and avoid unnecessary data collection wherever possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open source.</strong> Every code we write is public, transparency you can verify, not just trust. <a href="https://github.com/VSRemoter/LuxPDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the repo</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free. Really, truly Free.</strong> No freemium model, no paywalls, no watermarks, no trials, no limited usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple, not over-bloated.</strong> Do the simple things better than everyone else, not focusing on adding every feature humanely possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A very important aspect of LuxPDF, is that: privacy isn’t a feature. It’s the foundation.</p>

                <p>If you’ve ever hesitated to upload a document because it felt risky, you’re not alone, not even a little. We literally built LuxPDF for that exact reason.</p>

                <p><strong>Try the tools</strong> on our homepage, or audit the code yourself on <a href="https://github.com/VSRemoter/LuxPDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Your documents deserve respect.</p>
                
                <hr>

                <h2>Everyone talks about what they will do, but what are some things we won't do developing LuxPDF?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No silent uploads:</strong> None of our tools will ever be server-side. We won’t move your files anywhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>No data selling. Ever:</strong> The only possible data we collect are through Plausible.io and BuyMeACoffee.</li>
                    <li><strong>No features held hostage:</strong> You will never pay a premium, or be forced to sign up to use any feature.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Ok it sounds great and all but, how do you guys plan to make money? What is your motive?</h2>
                <p>LuxPDF might sound way too good to be true, I mean, what's in it for us? Well, a couple of things.
                    For one, we're in a college, and college means we're looking for jobs and other opportunities. We're hoping that 
                    LuxPDF could be an amazing tool to add to our resumes. It's a win/win situation, because it means that LuxPDF is 
                    a tool you guys can use to make your lives easier, and a tool that we can use to make our resumes look better.
                </p>
